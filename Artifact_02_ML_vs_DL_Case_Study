# Artifact #2: Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning Case Study

## Overview
This artifact demonstrates my ability to analyze and differentiate between traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) by applying each approach to a real-world problem. The assignment required selecting one ML example and one DL example, explaining their applications, and evaluating the suitability of each approach for its specific task.

## Artifact Description
### **Machine Learning Example: House Price Prediction**
- **Approach:** Linear Regression  
- **Why ML:** Works effectively with structured, numeric data and offers high interpretability.  
- **Real-World Application:** Used by real estate platforms and financial institutions for market valuation and lending decisions.

### **Deep Learning Example: Image Recognition**
- **Approach:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- **Why DL:** Automatically extracts visual features from pixel data and excels at identifying complex patterns.  
- **Real-World Application:** Used in facial recognition, medical imaging, autonomous driving, and retail inventory systems.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding of ML vs. DL differences  
- Selecting appropriate AI methods for real-world scenarios  
- Application of linear regression and CNN concepts  
- Technical writing and APA formatting  
- Clear explanation of model suitability and limitations  

## Included Files
- **ML_DL_Assignment.docx** — Full APA-formatted report with title page and citations.

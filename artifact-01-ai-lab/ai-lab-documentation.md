# Artifact #1: AI Lab Documentation — Custom GPT Assistant (“Adalyze”)

## Title
AI Lab Documentation: Designing and Building a Custom GPT Assistant for Digital Marketing Analytics

## Introduction
This artifact showcases the work completed during the AI Lab assignment, where I created a custom GPT assistant using ChatGPT’s GPT Builder. The assistant—named **Adalyze**—was developed to analyze digital advertising campaigns and provide clear, actionable performance insights. This artifact demonstrates my understanding of large language models (LLMs), experimentation with multiple AI tools, and my ability to design and refine a model that serves a practical, professional purpose.

## Description
For this assignment, I explored several generative AI tools including ChatGPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Google Gemini Pro, and STORM AI. I compared their responses, analyzed their strengths, and observed how prompt quality influenced output. I then transitioned into building my own custom AI bot using ChatGPT. The assistant was designed to interpret campaign data, evaluate KPIs, identify performance trends, and provide users with structured recommendations.

The documentation includes:
- Observations from testing multiple LLMs  
- Experimentation with a pre-built marketing GPT  
- A problem-solving framework used to shape the assistant  
- A full breakdown of how Adalyze was created, trained, and refined  
- Testing scenarios that validated the assistant’s performance  
- Findings from reviewing ChatGPT’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy  

## Objective
The objective of this artifact was to:
- Gain hands-on experience with LLM behavior and prompt engineering  
- Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of multiple AI models  
- Build a functional assistant capable of analyzing digital marketing campaigns  
- Understand AI policies, data usage, and ethical considerations  
- Produce clear documentation that reflects the development process and results  

## Process
### 1. Practice With LLMs  
I tested ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and STORM AI using the same marketing-related prompt. Each model produced distinct results, which helped me compare clarity, depth, accuracy, and relevance.

### 2. Experiment With a Custom GPT  
I used a popular “Marketing GPT” to explore how custom instruction-based models behave. This allowed me to observe:
- How GPTs handle confidential history  
- How they interpret and adapt to marketing strategies  
- How detailed their reasoning becomes when prompted  

### 3. Establish a Problem-Solving Framework  
I reflected on real-world problem-solving habits:
- Gathering necessary information  
- Identifying root issues  
- Choosing solutions that consider both data and people  
- Evaluating impact and adjusting when needed  

This framework influenced the structure of my assistant.

### 4. Building My Assistant: Adalyze  
I defined:
- **Objective:** Analyze digital marketing metrics  
- **Knowledge Base:** Analytics templates, marketing KPIs, industry benchmarks  
- **Boundaries:** No legal, medical, or personal advice outside analytics  
- **Tone:** Professional, friendly, and inviting  
- **Capabilities:** Read images, generate visualizations, export analysis  

I implemented a **behavioral flow** the assistant must follow:
1. Understand the task  
2. Break requests into actionable steps  
3. Provide accurate KPI analysis  
4. Offer a ready-to-use template  

### 5. Testing & Quality Control  
I tested Adalyze with real Google Ads metrics. At first, the assistant ignored uploaded metric columns. I resolved this by refining its instructions and adding clarity about data interpretation.

A successful test scenario showed that Adalyze could:
- Analyze campaign performance  
- Explain KPI behavior  
- Offer strategic insights  
- Prepare exportable report formats  

### 6. Review of ChatGPT Policies  
Key takeaways included:
- OpenAI collects usage and device data  
- Data is used to improve services  
- Users retain rights over their data  
- Policies update as technology evolves  

## Tools and Technologies Used
- ChatGPT GPT Builder  
- ChatGPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Google Gemini Pro, STORM AI  
- Digital marketing frameworks and KPI structures  
- Microsoft Word / Google Docs for documentation  
- Image-reading and visualization tools inside GPT  

## Value Proposition

### Unique Value
This artifact demonstrates my ability to design a specialized AI assistant that supports real marketing workflows. It shows I can evaluate multiple AI tools, understand their differences, and translate professional expertise into a functional GPT model.

### Relevance
Digital marketing increasingly relies on analytics, automation, and AI-assisted decision-making. The ability to create an AI tool like Adalyze has direct professional application—improving accuracy, speeding up analysis, and supporting organizations in making data-backed decisions.
